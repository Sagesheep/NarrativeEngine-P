// One-Shot Event Injector v1 — pure registry + directive composer.
//
// A one-shot is "something happens NOW, in this scene": the player picks an
// event type, presses FIRE, and the directive rides their NEXT sent message
// into the LLM input for that single turn (appended AFTER the historyInput
// capture in turnOrchestrator, exactly like the dice/loot tags). It fires
// once and vanishes — no storage, no lifecycle, no tool calls, no extra LLM
// calls. See WORKORDER-oneshot-injector.md.
//
// This module is pure: no store, no I/O. The orchestrator imports
// `buildOneShotDirective` and the UI imports `ONE_SHOT_EVENT_TYPES`.

// §4.8 SHARED INTRODUCTION RULES — appended after the directive, identical
// for every type. Kept as a single constant so the test-3 byte-identity lock
// holds by construction.
const SHARED_INTRODUCTION_RULES = `INTRODUCTION RULES — binding:
- The event must EMERGE FROM THE CURRENT SCENE. Do not cut away, teleport the player, or restart the scene. Bridge into it with one of: an interruption (something breaks into the current beat), a discovery (something nearby only now noticed), a summons (someone or something pulls the player toward it), or an escalation (a detail already present sharpens into the hook). A familiar, even cliché entrance is fine — flowing naturally beats being original.
- Express the event entirely in this world's established genre, technology level, and tone. Never import furniture from another setting.
- The event INVITES; it does not hijack. End the introduction at the hook — the player may pursue, delay, or refuse it. Do not narrate the player's reaction or decision for them.`;
