/**
 * Archive witness lists hold display names, never ledger ids: the server
 * heuristic (`server/lib/nlp.js`), the LLM witness pass and the seal
 * correction all write names. Readers that compared them against NPC ids
 * matched nothing, so every witnessed scene was treated as unwitnessed.
 * Anything that needs ids (on-stage checks) or canonical names (labels)
 * resolves witnesses through here.
 *
 * Resolution order, per witness:
 *   1. a ledger id (legacy and test data) → that NPC;
 *   2. an exact name or alias, case- and space-insensitive → every NPC
 *      carrying it (duplicate ledger entries for one person both match);
 *   3. a first- or last-word match ("Rin" → "Rin Holmes"), only when exactly
 *      one NPC fits. "Holmes" with two Holmeses resolves to nothing.
 * Unknown names ("The Voice", heuristic noise such as place names) resolve to
 * nothing.
 *
 * Pure, no I/O. Results are cached per resolver, so build one per turn.
